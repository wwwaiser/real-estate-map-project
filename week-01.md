    - [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
    - [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
    - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
    - Visual Studio GitLens extension (you already have it)

- ✅ **GitHub Repository:**
  - Create a GitHub repository for the project to share and collaborate on code. [Creating a new repository on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo)
  - Share URL to your repo with a project Leader
  - Add link to your trello board to the README.md file in your repository

## Initialize Project

- ✅ **Create Skeleton Project with Next.js:**
  - Utilize Next.js to set up the skeleton of our project. Make sure it runs without errors. [Next.js Setup](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started)
 
  ✅ **Learn Next.js basics:**
  
- ✅ **Setup ESLint:**
  - Ensure ESLint is properly configured in your IDE to highlight warnings and errors, promoting code quality. [ESLint Setup](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started)

- ✅ **Create Pull Request with your changes:**
  - Please make all your changes in a separate branch and create a pull-request to make it available for review, assign your Project Leader as a reviewer. [How to create Pull Request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

- 🌟 **Add Material-UI:**
  - Integrate Material-UI into your project for a rich set of UI components. [Material-UI Installation](https://mui.com/getting-started/installation/)

## Basic Project Structure

- 🌟 **Design Basic Page Layout:**
  - Create a layout with a header, sidebar, and content block using Material-UI components. This task is crucial for understanding how to structure React components and use Material-UI.

## Learn and Experiment

- 🌟 **Begin Learning:**
  - For those unfamiliar with React, GraphQL, or Material-UI, start by exploring their documentation and tutorials. Spend time creating simple components and queries to get a feel for these technologies.

## Hosting the Project on Vercel

- 🌟 **Deploy on Vercel:**
  - After setting up your project, consider deploying it on Vercel for real-world exposure. Vercel specializes in hosting for JavaScript projects, particularly Next.js applications, providing a seamless deployment experience. This step is recommended for those who are interested in showcasing their work online. Follow the guide to deploy your Next.js app on Vercel: [Deploying Next.js on Vercel](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)

## Add authentication

- 🌟 **User/Password Authentication:**
  - For a more challenging task, implement [Credentials](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/credentials) authentication using the NextAuth library. This introduces you to Next.js' API routes and authentication. [NextAuth.js Documentation](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/introduction)

## Explore Mapbox and GraphQL

- 🌟 **Mapbox Account:**
  - Create a free Mapbox account and explore Mapbox Studio to familiarize yourself with map customization. [Mapbox Official Site](https://www.mapbox.com/)

- 🌟 **GraphQL Basics:**
  - Learn the basics of GraphQL queries and mutations, considering how GraphQL could be used for data management in our project. [Introduction to GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/)

This comprehensive list aims to cover everything from setup to advanced exploration, ensuring you're well-prepared for the exciting journey ahead. Good luck!
