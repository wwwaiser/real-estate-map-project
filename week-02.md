# Week 2: Diving into Mapbox GL with react-map-gl

Welcome to Week 2 of our microinternship! This week, we'll focus on integrating and exploring Mapbox GL using the `react-map-gl` library. It's crucial to complete all required tasks from Week 1 before proceeding.

Please dont push your changes directly to the main branch. All your activities has to be done in a sepparate branch and Pull Requests has to be created at the end of the week, to allow project leader to review the code and provide feedback

## Required Tasks

- âœ… **Complete All Week 1 Required Tasks:**
  - Ensure all tasks from Week 1 are completed and understood. This includes setting up your development environment, initializing your project with Next.js, and integrating Material-UI.

- âœ… **Rename your trello boards:**
  - {FirstName} {LastName} - OpenAvenue

- âœ… **Host Application on Vercel:**
  - Deploy your Next.js application on Vercel. Follow the [Vercel Deployment Documentation](https://vercel.com/docs) for guidance.

- âœ… **Create Basic Layout:**
  - Develop a basic page layout if not completed in Week 1. This should include a header, sidebar, and content area.

## Main Focus of the Week

- âœ… **Create Map Component:**
  - Integrate a Map component in your application using `react-map-gl`. This will be your first step into adding interactive maps to your web app.
  - If you dont have mapbox account you can utilize the following mapbox access token: pk.eyJ1Ijoic3ZheXNlciIsImEiOiJjbGgwbzl5NXcwdmMzM2VwdTkya2J6cDVmIn0.VrQewCt9w1K8QPsLzuDZjg

## Exploring `react-map-gl`

The primary goal this week is to explore and experiment with `react-map-gl`, a React-friendly wrapper around Mapbox GL. You'll learn how to add various map features to your application.

- âœ… **Set Up `react-map-gl`:**
  - Begin by integrating `react-map-gl` into your project. Follow the setup instructions in the library's documentation: [react-map-gl GitHub](https://github.com/visgl/react-map-gl).

- âœ… **Experiment with Map Components:**
  - Spend time understanding and implementing different components available in `react-map-gl`. Focus on adding standard map features such as Pins, Popups, and Layers.
    - Pins: Learn how to place and customize pins on the map.
    - Popups: Implement popups to show information when a pin or specific map area is clicked.
    - Layers: Explore how to add various layers to the map, customizing its appearance and interactivity.

## Advanced Tasks (Optional)

- ðŸŒŸ **Advanced Map Features:**
  - For those seeking additional challenges, try integrating more complex map features such as dynamic data layers, navigation controls, or custom markers.

## Deliverables

- By the end of the week, ensure your application:
  - Is hosted on Vercel with the basic layout implemented.
  - Contains a Map component utilizing `react-map-gl` with at least Pins and Popups demonstrated.
  - All code changes should be in a sepparate branch with a Pull Request to the main branch
